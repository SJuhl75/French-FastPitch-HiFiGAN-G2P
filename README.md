# French-FastPitch-HiFiGAN-G2P
This repo documents experiments, demos, and notes on French Text-to-Speech (TTS) using **FastPitch**, **HiFi-GAN**, and **G2P** (grapheme-to-phoneme conversion).

## Overview
- **FastPitch**: A text-to-speech model that generates mel-spectrograms from text input.
- **HiFi-GAN**: A generative adversarial network for high-fidelity audio synthesis.
- **G2P**: A system that converts written text into phonetic representations.
